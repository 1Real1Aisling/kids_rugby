# Features

* Navigation
   * There is a navigation bar located at the top of the page. This bar includes the website name/logo in the top left which is linked to the home page, making it easy for visiors to navigate back to the homepage at any time. 
   * There are five (5) other navigation links whihc are positioned to the right of the navigation bar. These all link to different areas on the website. The links are: Home, About, Programmes, Team coaches and Join us.
   * The font chosen is clean and clear. It is in a dark navy colour which has a very high contrast with the white background. I had originally chosen a dark grey for the font colour, but this did not contrast very well.
   * There is additional navigation in the footer. This is benefiical as it enables the user to navigate seamlessly through the site even if they are at the bottom of a page.
   * Both the clarity and ease of access to the navigation links makes this an easy site to navigate either on esktop or mobile.

* Hidden pages

There are 3 hidden pages from the website that are not available from the navigation bar:
* Privacy policy - the link to this is on the "Join us" form, if the visitor clicks on this they are brought to a different tab, however it opens in a new tab but also has the full navigation bar and footer.
* Terms & conditions - this behaves in the same way as the Privacy Policy.
* Thank you page - when a visitor completes the "Join us" form they are brought to this page, it opens in a new tab but also has the full navigation bar and footer.

# Future features

The next version of the site will inlude the ability to find local teams and coaches to learning the rules of the game. There will also be informative articles, videos, and resources available from expert contributors.

# Testing

* I tested that the pages works in Chrome.
* The website is responsive on all standard screen sizes, looks well and performs well.
* We "Join us" form works very well, there are required elements that mean the form can't be submitted without them, the "County" field provides suggestions for all 32 counties when a letter is placed in the box. The visitor can multi-select programmes and is guided how to do this. Prior to submitting the form, the visitor must accept the T&Cs and Privcay Policy, these links open in new tabs meaning the visitor can still view them and retain access to their partially completed form. On completion the visitor is brought to a "Thank you" page whihc informs them that a member of the coahing staff will be in touch, providing a nice user experience.

# Validator testing
* HTML - https://validator.w3.org/
  * I found many errors in my pages, and carried out testing on multiple occassions as I constantly was updating my code. However on the final test of each page, there were no errors in my code.
* CSS - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator
  *   As with the html, there were multiple errors in my CSS code, however I worked my way through them and on the final testing no errors were present.
* Accessibility
  *   I really enjoyed refining and improving the accessiibility and performance of the website based on the feedback recieved. I researched the best colour contrasts, alt text and fonts. I am realy happy with the results shown via Lighthouse.

# Bugs

Frustratingly there were bugs when I deployed my website . The issues were mainly images which required the updating of the filepaths, once this was done the images appeared without issue. Some key learns here however are the "CTRL, SHIFT, R" shortcut to refresh the website as I spent time trying to fix an issue that was already resolved, only my browser did not refresh. Also patience is important, as I spent time undoing work I had completed only to realise the work I had done was  correct it just hadn't deployed.

# Unfixed bugs

No unfixed bugs.

# Deployment

* The website was deployed to GitHub pages. These were the steps:
  * Go to the GitHub repository.
